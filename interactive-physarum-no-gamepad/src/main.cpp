// Work derived 36 Points by Sage Jenson (mxsage) but with a different implementation.
// Before studying mxsage's code I already had a physarum implementation (already inspired by their work),
// I modified it to use the most important aspects of their algorithm in 36 Points.

// This project is using counters on pixels and this is different.
// It's using the set of parameters from 36 Points, some points work well, some don't, I had to tune stuff and I kept what worked.
// It's introducing spatial interpolation between points and a lot of interaction features.
